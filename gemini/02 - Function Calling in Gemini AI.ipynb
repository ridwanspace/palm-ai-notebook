    "## Calling functions from Gemini\n",
    "[`Function calling`](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/multimodal/function-calling) lets developers create a description of a function in their code, then pass that description to a language model in a request. The response from the model includes the name of a function that matches the description and the arguments to call it with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function calling is similar to Vertex AI Extensions in that they both generate information about functions. The difference between them is that function calling returns JSON data with the name of a function and the arguments to use in your code, whereas Vertex AI Extensions returns the function and calls it for you.\n",

    "In this tutorial, you'll build a generative AI pipeline with the Vertex AI Gemini Pro (gemini-pro) model and Python. Using your app, users can ask about exchange rates, and the system will fetch the latest data from an external API and respond to the user with the answer.\n",

       "**The Partition of India** was the division of the British Indian Empire into two independent dominions, India and Pakistan, effective from midnight of 14 August 1947. The partition involved the geographical division of the Indian subcontinent as well as the division of its armed forces, civil services, and other resources.\n",

The Indian National Congress, which represented the Hindu majority, demanded independence from British rule and the creation of a united India. The Muslim League, which represented the Muslim minority, demanded the creation of a separate Muslim state in India.\n",

       "In 1946, the British government announced its plan to divide India into two dominions, India and Pakistan. The plan was accepted by the Indian National Congress but was rejected by the Muslim League. The Muslim League launched a direct action campaign, which resulted in communal violence and riots in Calcutta and other cities.\n",

    "![Function Calling](../assets/gemini-function-calling.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Define a function and tool\n",

    "```\n",
    "API Specification → Function Declaration → Tool\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Model → Tool → Function call with parameters\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Make an API request\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Function call with parameters → API → Response\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### D. Return a summary\n",
    "Finally, we'll pass the function response back to the model so that it can generate a response to the end-user's initial prompt. This step involves returning the function response along with the previous conversation turns to the model, then handling the final response.\n",
