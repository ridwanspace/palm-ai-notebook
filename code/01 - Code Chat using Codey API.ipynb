    "This notebook provides an introduction to code chat generation using Codey chat models, specifically the `codechat-bison` foundation model. Code chat enables developers to interact with a chatbot for assistance with code-related tasks, including debugging, documentation, and learning new concepts. The `codechat-bison` model is designed to facilitate multi-turn conversations, allowing for a more natural and interactive coding experience.\n",

       "\n",
       "* **Decorator:** A decorator is a function that takes another function as its argument and returns a modified version of that function. Decorators are used to add additional functionality to functions without modifying their original code. In this case, the `memoize` and `lru_cache` functions are decorators that add memoization and LRU caching functionality to the decorated functions, respectively.\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Memoization:** Memoization is a technique that stores the results of function calls so that they can be reused later without having to recalculate them. This can improve the performance of a program by reducing the number of times a function is called. In this case, the `memoize` function implements memoization by storing the results of the decorated function in a dictionary.\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache:** An LRU cache is a data structure that stores a fixed number of items. When a new item is added to the cache, the least recently used item is removed to make room for the new item. This ensures that the most recently used items are always in the cache. In this case, the `lru_cache` function implements an LRU cache by using a dictionary and a deque to keep track of the items in the cache.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why use complex code vs. simple code?**\n",
       "\n",
       "In some cases, it may be necessary to use complex code to achieve the desired functionality. For example, the `memoize` and `lru_cache` functions are complex because they need to handle various scenarios, such as checking for existing keys in the cache, updating the cache, and removing items from the cache when it reaches its maximum size. While these functions may be more complex to understand and implement, they can provide significant performance benefits by reducing the number of times a function is called and by keeping frequently used results in memory."

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Chain of Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain of Verification (CoVe) prompting is a technique for refining the code generated by large language models (LLMs) by employing a self-verification process. It aims to mitigate the potential for hallucinations and inaccuracies in the generated code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CoVe process involves four key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Drafting an Initial Response: The LLM generates an initial code response based on the provided natural language description.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Planning Verification Questions: A set of verification questions is formulated to scrutinize the accuracy and completeness of the initial code response.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Executing Verification: The verification questions are independently answered, either by the LLM itself or by external sources, to minimize potential biases in the verification process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Generating a Final Verified Response: Based on the answers to the verification questions, the LLM refines the initial code response to produce a final, more accurate, and reliable code output.\n",
    "\n",
    "CoVe prompting has demonstrated improved performance in code generation tasks compared to traditional prompting methods, resulting in more accurate and reliable code outputs."

    "        Your goal is to generate code based on what a user has asked, and to keep modifying the code based on the user's verification rules.\n",
    "        Verification rules are not the same as test functions or test cases.\n",

    "          Step 1: Initial Setup for function 'calculate_n_factorial'\n",
    "            - Add input:\n",

    "              - temp: store temporary values\n",
    "          As, first step, generate a code to calculate the factorial of a number and setup the function and variables.\n",
    "        and then provides the following verification rules:\n",
    "          Step 2: Verification steps for the factorial function\n",
    "            - The code should return 1 for the input 0.\n",

    "\n",
    "Self-consistency prompting is a technique for enhancing the quality of code generated by large language models (LLMs) by leveraging the model's ability to identify and favor consistent patterns in its reasoning. It aims to address the issue of inconsistent or erroneous code generation by introducing a mechanism for selecting the most consistent and reliable code output among multiple possible options.\n",
    "\n",
    "The self-consistency prompting process involves three key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generate Multiple Reasoning Paths: The LLM generates multiple distinct reasoning paths, which represent different approaches to solving the given code generation task.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Evaluate Consistency: For each reasoning path, the LLM evaluates the consistency of its intermediate steps and the final code output. This involves identifying patterns, checking for contradictions, and ensuring alignment with the natural language description.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Select the Most Consistent Response: Based on the consistency evaluation, the LLM selects the reasoning path that exhibits the highest level of consistency and produces the most reliable code output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-consistency prompting has shown effectiveness in improving the accuracy and reliability of generated code, particularly for complex or ambiguous tasks. It has been demonstrated to reduce the occurrence of inconsistencies and errors, leading to more robust and trustworthy code generation."

    "#### 3. Tree of Thought\n",
    "\n",
    "Tree of Thought (ToT) prompting is a technique for guiding large language models (LLMs) to generate code by breaking down the task into a hierarchical structure of intermediate natural language steps. This approach aims to address the limitations of traditional prompting methods, which can lead to LLM getting stuck in local optima or generating code that is not well-structured or optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ToT prompting process involves three key steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decomposing the Task: The natural language description of the task is broken down into a series of smaller subtasks, forming a tree-like structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Generating Intermediate Thoughts: For each subtask in the tree, the LLM generates a corresponding intermediate thought, which is a natural language explanation of how to solve that subtask.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Constructing the Code: The LLM combines the intermediate thoughts into a cohesive and structured code output, following the hierarchical organization of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "ToT prompting has demonstrated advantages over traditional prompting methods in code generation tasks, particularly for complex or multi-step problems. It helps the LLM to reason about the problem in a more structured and systematic way, leading to more efficient and reliable code generation."
